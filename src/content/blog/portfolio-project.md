## Description  

I used Astro to create a personalized portfolio website that showcases my professional journey and accomplishments. This platform provides detailed information about my background, skills, and experiences, giving visitors an insight into my expertise and interests. The website features a carefully designed interface that allows users to explore various aspects of my work, including select projects I have worked on. It serves as a digital resume and a testament to my creative vision and technical proficiency in using cutting-edge web development tools.


## Technologies

I created this projected using Astro.

## Why

I utilized Astro to develop this project because it is one of my favorite tools for building static websites. The development process is impressively fast and intuitive. Unlike other frameworks, it doesn't burden you with excessive JavaScript overhead, yet it remains highly adaptable.
