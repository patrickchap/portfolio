## Description  

I designed and implemented a customized wedding website to simplify the event planning and guest management processes. The website exhibits all necessary information about the wedding, including venue details and schedule, and incorporates advanced guest list management features. Through an easy-to-use interface, guests can quickly RSVP online, which allows for efficient tracking of attendance and meal preferences. This project showcases my ability to merge front-end design with back-end functionality to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for wedding organizers and guests.

## Technologies

I created this projected using Next.js, MySQL, tRPC, and Tailwind.

## Why

There are many tools available to create wedding websites, but personally, I enjoy building things from scratch. It gives me a chance to learn new technologies and improve my skills. Although I have been using React for a few years, the projects I have worked on were relatively small and didn't meet my needs. So, I decided to try using Next.js, a framework I've been interested in, to build a wedding website. It was a great opportunity to learn Next.js and tRPC while working on a larger project. I needed a website to display information about my wedding and to have an RSVP system to know how many people will be attending. Additionally, I added a feature that allows my fianc√© and me to add guests and group them. Guests can also select their meal preferences. I plan to add more features like seating charts and tracking thank-you notes after the event.
