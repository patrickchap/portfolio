## Description  

This is a project to monitor services. It has the abilty to configure hosts, and add services such as http and https to monitor. I plan to extend this project to send notifications when a service is down. 

## Technologies

This project was completed using Go. I utilized TEMPL for the frontend, and sqlite for data storage. 

## Why

I have been interested in Go for a while, and I wanted a larger project to explore and improve my ability to use Go.
